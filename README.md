# Used-Macbook-Price-Estimator
I helped a local mom-and-pop electronic shop build an ML-driven approach to pricing used MacBook and improve their monthly sales revenue by over 70%

Steps: 
1. Data Acquisition: the dataset is scraped from Craigslist (MacBook listings within 300 miles of NYC) 
2. EDA 
3. Feature Engineering 
4. Feature Selection 
5. Model Training 
6. Hyperparameter Tuning 
7. Model Deployment
